# Learning-JavaScript-My-Way
My own way to learn JavaScript. Simple and to the point. (and hopefully fun too!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So there are two main things that I have learned off the bat about JavaScript:
1. *It is confusing as hell.
2. *Trying to find a tutorial that teaches you in laymen's terms about either costs you and arm and a leg, or is non-existant.

So here's my bright idea.
I am going to be teaching myself Javascript and posting it in this repository. (*this covers the "accountability to one's self" rule*) I will be doing things from different sources and other codenewbies are welcome to clone this repo and work on the projects yourself, and feel free to make changes and show me what you did! We can learn together.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't ask me how to do pull requests or sync repos or any of that other stuff, because I am still trying to figure that out. One thing at a time lol.
