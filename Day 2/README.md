Day 2: Keeping it Simple

This Folder contains an HTML file, a CSS file and a JS file.

Since anyone reading this should understand the HTML and the CSS pages, (*If you don't, feel free to ask questions!*) I am going to concentrate on the JS part.

Today I just changed the very same code that we used yesterday, but instead of asking for the date, I performed a little of that magic that I had mentioned. Once you grab the 3 files and add them to their own folder on your computer, go ahead and view the HTML file in your browser. Make sure that you pay attention to the text that was added in the first paragraph when you hit that button.

If you are a JS newbie like I am, feel free to tinker with the code, change the text, make the button different colors, anything you want, as long as it helps you *learn* since that's the main goal here. 

Don't forget to show me what you have done if you do tinker with it!

Until tomorrow!
