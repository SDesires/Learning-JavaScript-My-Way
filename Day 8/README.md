<h1>Day 8: Javascript Sounds Continued</h1>

<p>I wanted something fun and yet beginner friendly to do to close out my first week, so I went around perusing the web for that very thing. I happened upon a youtube video of a gentleman who posted a video called, "<i>JavaScript Tutorial For Beginners: Learn AUDIO in 1 hour</i>". Having watched other videos before, I wasn't hopeful, since a lot of them go to fast even if you try to pause the video and it gets frustrating when you are trying to learn. This one is different and I have been having a lot of fun following his instruction on my own and making audio visualizers. Since I don't know if anyone else even reads this, I was tempted to just post the whole thing when I was done with the full video. However, the way he breaks it down, it really deserves to have separate sections to it.</p>

<p>If you do come across this, then my suggestion is to do one section at a time, and write the code as he does in the video. Pause as much as you need to. (I am!) The added bonus is that he explains what exactly he is doing and what each line does IN PLAIN ENGLISH!!!! I'm loving it! Feel free to experiment once you are comfortable and show me what you made since this really is a fun project. All the links that you need are below. I have included the files that I have used, but it's not written in stone that you have to use the same ones.</p>
