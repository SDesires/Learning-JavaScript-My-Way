<h1>Day 3: Changing Things</h1>

<p>Today is a bit of a review of the last two days. If you grab the files from this folder and put them in a folder on your computer and then open the html file in your browser, you will see 3 buttons at the top and each one changes a different thing on the page, and yes, this includes the picture. Now, you will probably notice that I added the Javascript in the HTML document this time. This is due to my inexperience with the language and not being able to make it work as an external script. I still have a lot to learn.</p>
