<h1>Day 6: Opening windows with JS </h1>

<p>In JavaScript, there are tow main ways to run scripts on a page. The first one is direct script execution (like we are doing today) and the second is execution in response to user action (i.e. buttons and the like.)</p>

<p>In today's file, there is a script in the HTML page to open up a separate window on your browser to google.com. Feel free to play around with the string to familiarize yourself with it, change it to go to another earch engine that you use or some other page. If you are like me and have an adblocker on, you might get a notification that a pop-up was blocked. Double check that it's the page that is indicated in the script.</p>
