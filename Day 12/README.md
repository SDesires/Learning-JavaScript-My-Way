<h1>Day 12: To-do List</h1>

<p>Today I followed another tutorial on Youtube, and on it, I learned how to make a simple to-do list in HTML, CSS, and of course, JS. These are my files that I made by following the video.</p>

The link to the video that I followed today is here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ttf3CEsEwMQ">Beginner Vanilla Javascript Project Tutorial</a> by 
Dev Ed.
He is another person that explains what the code does and how to get it to do what you want it to do in plain terms. 

Good luck and happy Coding! :)
