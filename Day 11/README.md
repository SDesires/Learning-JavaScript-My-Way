<h1>Day 11: Dino Game!</h1>

<p>Today I followed another tutorial on Youtube, and on it, I learned how to make a simple game in HTML, CSS, and of course, JS. These are my files that I made by following the video, although I am going to try to make my own with different assets for practice and give it it's own repository.</p>

The link to the video that I followed today is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oz34co7VLY">Easy JavaScript Game Tutorial</a> by Kris Foster.
He is another person that explains what the code does and how to get it to do what you want it to do in plain terms. 

Good luck and happy Coding! :)
