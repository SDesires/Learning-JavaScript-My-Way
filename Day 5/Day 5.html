    <h2>Day 5: Review</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Any part of JS that is in parenthesis and has a semicolon after it is called a <i>string</i>
	<li>JS has it's own version of variables that are written like <code>var firstName = "Your name here";</code></li>
	<li>JS can do math for you!<button id="answer" onclick="myFunction()">What is 39 + 40</button></li>
	<li>That math problem was part of a <i>function</i> that I actually wrote correctly the FIRST TIME!</li>
	</ul>
	
<script>
    alert(" This alert is a string");
	function myFunction() {
	document.getElementById('answer').innerHTML = 39 + 40;
	}
</script>
