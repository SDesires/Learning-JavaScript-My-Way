<h1>Day 5: What I have learned so far </h1>

<p>In JavaScript, when you surround a word with quotes it's called a string, and when you're done with a line of code you finish it with a semicolon. In order to call a function, you simply write its name (this time without quotes) and end it with a set of parentheses. So in the past days, we have been dealing with functions.</p>

<p>To store values in containers so we can use them later, you use a variable. It works just like the variable in CSS. JS can also do math (just keep in mind that numbers don't need qoutation marks)</p>
