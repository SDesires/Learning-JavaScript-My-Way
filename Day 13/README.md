<h1>Day 12: Color Flipper</h1>

<p>Today I followed another tutorial on Youtube, and on it, I learned how to make a simple color flipper in JS. These are my files that I made by following the video.(the CSS is copied from his, in my standalone project, I'll be making my own)</p>

The link to the video that I followed today is here: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4">Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course</a> by FreeCodeCamp.

Good luck and happy Coding! :)
